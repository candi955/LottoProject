Project_3_APIs

This is a project for school.  I attempted to the best of my ability to add any references utilized to create this program within all of the program header notes.  It's basically a lottery prediction program, with various menus that have different ways to look at lottery numbers.  It is based off of the winning AZ Powerball numbers from January until July 2019; a very small set of data.  However, this was due to the time constraints of the due date on the school project.  

There were also many different APIs utilized.  There are a few files that, in reality, I might have chosen a different way (API) to implement them.  However, as this program was built over the period of a school course, the course often required me to show the ability to utilize particular APIs, which thus are now included within my project, to sometimes perform seemingly random  tasks.  

Although I utilized referenced projects online and from books and websites to create this, I attempted to update all the code by adding User-Input, menus, and pulling my data from homemade data sources.  Basically, I attempted to individualize everything.  I'm hoping if anybody else is ever attempting the same thing with their code, that they might be able to utilize this as a helpful reference on how to do that (such as cleaning up a homemade dataset, etc).  

I am still new to Python and Machine Learning at this point, so please forgive any sytax errors, and feel free to let me know if any improvements need made in case another newbie references this code for help at any point.  Thank you.
