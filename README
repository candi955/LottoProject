This project has been created as a functional program for a school project for the Advanced Programming class taught by
Dr. Jill Coddington at the University of Advancing Technology. It is a Pycharm, Python project that practice utilizing
various APIs.  My individual program has the goal of guiding the user through various choices and modules which allow
the user to explore possible future winning numbers, months, and predictions concerning the Arizona Powerball lottery.

It should be noted that my dataset is rather small, and that this program is for experimental, learning, and 
entertainment purposes only.  The build of this program at this time is not likely to be very accurate, but does teach
the functioning of various APIs, including some Machine Learning (ML) APIs and algorithms. 

It should be noted that the main user-menu is on mainPage.py, for those wishing to utilize the program menus to reach
various modules/individual programs within the main program itself. 

This code/program is meant for educational purposes at this time. It is considered open-source.
